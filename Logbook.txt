Downloaded Node.js, LTS version default settings.
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
In command prompt, use "node" go in and out of using it to write java (I think)
"npm install cat-me" >> write "cat-me.js" file >> "node cat-me.js" in command prompt

[SOMETHING ABOUT npm init in commamd prompt]
npm init [Some options have appeared, I enter keyed through them]
npm install express --save
This creates node-modules folder and some .json files.

Make new folders in main MedTrack folders:
views >> Put .html files in here
public\stylesheets >> Put .css files in here

Change .html extensions to .ejs, they have the same syntax. We don't have a html renderer so can;t just use .html in our .js file
npm install ejs --save To use .html files as .ejs files in the .js file
npm install path --save TO use .css files in the .js file

Create new folder:
view\partials >> Create header.ejs and footer.ejs to be used for all our webpages, so no need to copy the same code to all .ejs files.

Added references such as /login, /register to buttons across the .ejs files.
